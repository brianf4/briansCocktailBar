A site where you can request a drink. If you don't know what you want there is a random generating button that will serve you up a random drink.

## How its made
**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

A fun project I was working on to learn all about API's. Here I'm using the [Cocktail Database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) where I'm pulling data from their databse so that you can request a drink to be made for you or if you don't know what you want get a random suggestion by hitting the random drink button.
